# simple-data-generator
## Context
This library is mainly meant to be used as learning project for library development and all the challenges associated with it.  

## Goals
The main goal of the library is to create a mechanism which can populate fields of POJOs with realistic data using only features present JDK (i.e. no 3rd party libraries).

## Alternatives
Given that the nature of this project is mostly R&D and targets my personal needs it might not be suitable for enterprise applications therefore, if by any chance someone stumbles upon this project, with a need for data generation, please consider alternatives such as:
* [Instancio](https://www.instancio.org/user-guide/#junit-jupiter-integration)
* [Datafaker](https://www.datafaker.net/documentation/getting-started/)

The options listed above tackle the same problem while offering more extensive features and documentation.
